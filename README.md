# project-1
An exploration on the changes in electroencepholography (EEG) measurements in students during states of concentration and confusion. We are curious about the relationship of confused mental states and its visualization in EEG Data. Observations related to these patterns suggest a a possible biomarker for cognitive performance, in addition to a greater understastanding on the mechanisms of cognitive work in the human brain.

Research Questions to Answer (preliminary):
What frequency Band is pronounced in relation to attention?(attention vs freq color coded to alpha,beta,theta,delta)
What Frequency Band is most pronounced in confused Students vs non confused students?
Are ‘calm students' more likely to be confused? (confusion user defined vs calm) and (non confusion user defined vs calm) Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanghaohan/confused-eeg
Breakdown:
Merge Demographics and EEG Data dataframes
Utilize “.groupby()” and “.loc[]” functions to segment dataframe to relevant groups
Utilize MatPlotLib to visualize EEG Data
Summarize Findings to answer our research questions.
